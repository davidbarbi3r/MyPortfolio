A key point in the user experience of a website or web application is loading time. Visitors are becoming increasingly impatient. Most of them will abandon a site if it doesn't load within 3 seconds. For a company, this means lost sales, leads and opportunities. 

Conversely, a fast, fluid site will improve your brand image, your sales and your natural referencing. It's a virtuous circle. 

## What levers should I use to ensure my site's performance?

### Image optimization : 

Images are often the primary cause of the slowness of some websites. 
High-quality images don't have to slow down your performance. Compress them using efficient formats such as WebP, which combine visual quality with low weight.

### Hosting location :

The distance between your servers and your users influences response speed. Hosting close to your target reduces response times, a geographical detail with significant repercussions. If you have international customers, the use of a CDN is mandatory. 

### Rationalization of requests: 

Every request to the backend or database is a potential hindrance. Streamlining and optimizing these interactions is fundamental. Treat each request as a limited, precious resource.
Don't hesitate to use caching solutions to lighten the server load by remembering information rather than constantly searching for it.

### Lazy Loading: 

Adopt an intelligent loading strategy. Lazy loading delays the loading of non-essential resources until they are actually needed, thus optimizing initial loading speed and user experience.

### Rationalization of dependencies / packages used :

An excess of libraries and packages can unnecessarily weigh down your site. Take an inventory of your tools and eliminate the incidental. Use a minimalist approach for maximum performance.

As a complement, don't neglect the minification of CSS and JavaScript files, the adoption of content distribution networks (CDNs) and regular performance audits using specialized tools. Every action counts in the quest for a responsive site.

Your website is the mirror of your commitment to your users. Every optimization, every millisecond saved, enriches the experience you offer and testifies to your attention to detail.
